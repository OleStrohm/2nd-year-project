THANKS FOR CHECKING MY CODE OUT!!!

So UD and LR are the displacement from the midpoints (i.e. the position of the joystick when the code is first run)

For UD: 

UP --> positive, max = 508/509
DOWN --> negative, max = -489/-490

For LR:

RIGHT --> positive, max = 505/506
LEFT --> negative, max = -500/-501
